# Welcome to RUNO

RUNO is a browser-based multiplayer online game modeled after the popular card
game UNO. I hope you enjoy!

To play the game, visit the live site at https://runogame.com.

NOTE: I wrote the back end in Python in 2015 and ported it, somewhat recklessly, to
TypeScript in September of 2019. I plan on doing a rewrite someday.

The app is hosted in Google Cloud using App Engine and Cloud SQL.

PostgreSQL v11 should be used.
